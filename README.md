# Jenyx

Jenyx is a lightweight UI components library built with pure JavaScript. No dependencies, no frameworks — just clean JS and CSS-in-JS. Fast, flexible, and easy to use.

## Features

This library offers the following features:

- **Minimal size** — a lightweight library without unnecessary code.
- **Pure JavaScript** — no React, Vue, or other frameworks.
- **CSS-in-JS** — styles are encapsulated within components without external CSS files.
- **Event handling and two-way data binding** — enables easy interaction and synchronization between components and data.

Can be used as a foundation for your own UI kit.
